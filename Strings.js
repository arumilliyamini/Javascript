//String are used to text and manipulate text 
//strings can be created using the following syntax
let name_ = "Yamini"
console.log(name_.length);
//single quote 
let boyfriend = 'Eswar'
console.log(boyfriend)

//Template Literals
//template literals use backtics instead of quotes to define a string 
//with template literals it is possible to use both single as well as double quotes inside a string

console.log(name_[1])

let person1 = 'Yamini'
let person2 = 'Eswar'
//We can insert variables directly in template literal this is called string interpolation
console.log(`${person1} is ${person2} girlfriend`)

//Escape Sequence charecters
